Workshop: Flexdashboards
------------------------

Code and data in this repository supports an [Rfun](https://rfun.library.duke.edu) [DVS](https://library.duke.edu/data/) workshop for learning how to layout dashboards, add interactivity such as filters and **linked brushing** via HTML Widgets, (i.e. `crosstalk`).

Start with the demonstration `index.Rmd`. Knit that file to generate an example dashboard.
